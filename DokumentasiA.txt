Jealousy comes back at me
Take full control over me
I am losing myself
Losing myself again
Jealousy bring back to me
Pass over my serenity
I am losing myself
I'm losing myself today
I am not the only one
Can I be the only one?
Maybe someday you want me
Badly want me
Like you want me there with you before
Before you want someone else
Maybe someday I'll see you
Clearly see you
Like I see you through just like before
Before you see someone else
Before I'm just someone else
